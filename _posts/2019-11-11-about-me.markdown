Who am I?

I’m a person who has held what appear to be vastly contrasting positions over the course of her life. 

I’ve been a peer counselor and a math club president.       
A democrat and a republican.     
A [green and a blue](https://truecolorsintl.com/the-four-color-personalities/).     
A small-town Missouri girl and a Sydney CBD dweller.      
’The Nice One’ and ’The Smart One’.        
An international science fair award recipient and a crisis hotline responder.          
A people pleaser and a champion of boundary setting.      
A [sexual assault victim/survivor advocate and an aspiring data scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lorischlatter_tldr-becoming-a-data-scientist-with-the-activity-6608394452241395712-MYty). 

Some of these identities I hold simultaneously. Most of them have involved a journey from one to another. But with all of them, I’ve learned more from the difference and path between the two than I have from either identity independently. Just like a bracketed Python list, I can change, and I'm open to growth. 

I love bridging these gaps, which is why I’m excited to become a Data Scientist and bring data life in tangible, meaningful ways. The purpose of this website is to showcase how I'm learning to do that. 

I’ll be seeking positions after completion of my [Lambda School](www.lambdaschool.com) program in late 2020.
