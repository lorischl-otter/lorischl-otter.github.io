### Data Exploration: Why Do People Want to Leave Their Jobs?

What factors are correlated with people wanting to leave their jobs? After a brief analysis of the 2018 United States Office of Personnel Management Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey, I observed that satisfaction levels across all survey items were lower on average for those wanting to leave their jobs than those wanting to stay. Specifically, low overall job and organization satisfaction, as well as low satisfaction with talent utilization and promotion opportunities were most highly correlated with someone indicating they were thinking of leaving their job in the next year.
