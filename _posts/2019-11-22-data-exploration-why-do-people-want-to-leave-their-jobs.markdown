What factors are correlated with people wanting to leave their jobs? After a brief analysis of the 2018 United States Office of Personnel Management Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey, I observed that satisfaction levels across all survey items were lower on average for those wanting to leave their jobs than those wanting to stay. Specifically, low overall job and organization satisfaction, as well as low satisfaction with talent utilization and promotion opportunities were most highly correlated with someone indicating they were thinking of leaving their job in the next year. See my full [article](https://medium.com/@lori.schlatter/what-correlates-with-an-employee-wanting-to-leave-the-job-cde7249f74a) and link to my full [Python notebook](https://github.com/lorischl-otter/Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/Unit_1_Build_Week_Final_Notebook.ipynb).



>This analysis was completed as a student project in data exploration for the first unit (three weeks) of the Data Science track at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com). The goal of the project was to select a dataset and a research question, and then clean, explore, and visualize the data and articulate findings.
